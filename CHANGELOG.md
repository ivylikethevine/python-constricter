# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. Each release's full notes are generated from its merged pull requests
(grouped by `.github/release.yml`) on its
[GitHub release](https://github.com/ivylikethevine/python-constricter/releases).

## Unreleased

- **LVA007**: a name annotated again with the type it already has, in the same straight-line block
  (an `if`'s two arms, a `try`'s body and its `except`s, ... are compared separately, not against
  each other). A warning at every level, an error at `suffocate`.
- `--exclude` globs also match a directory name during a directory walk (like the built-in skip list
  for `__pycache__`, `venv`, hidden directories, ...), not just a whole path or file name.
- Enum bases and factory calls (`Enum`, `NamedTuple`, `TypeVar`, ...) are recognised by where
  they're imported from, in addition to their bare name, so an aliased or re-exported one is still
  found.
- `project.calls` finds a module/submodule import by name lookup instead of scanning every indexed
  module (`project.index` now returns a `project.Index`, not a plain `dict`).
- `tests/corpus.py` and `tests/corpus_fix.py` (checking and `--fix`-ing a large real codebase) run
  in CI's new Corpus job, against the runner's Python standard library.
- Fix: `--fix` could corrupt a line (and crash) if an offence's fix landed inside a multi-byte
  character; that one offence is now left unfixed instead. Found by the new Corpus job, on the
  Python 3.11 standard library.
- First release, 0.2.0: `LVA001`–`LVA006`, the `relaxed` to `suffocate` levels, a flake8 plugin, a
  pylint plugin and the `constricter` command (with `--fix`, `--diff`, `--explain`, `--select`,
  `--ignore`, `--statistics` and text, JSON, GitHub and SARIF output), configured from
  `[tool.constricter]` in `pyproject.toml`. Python 3.11+. Also baselines (`--write-baseline`,
  `--baseline`), Jupyter notebooks, a GitHub Action, `--jobs`, per-path levels, and JSON with
  comments wherever constricter reads JSON. `--coverage` reports annotation coverage; standard
  input, `gitlab`, `junit` and `rdjson` output, `--unsafe-fixes`, per-file ignores, `--exit-zero`
  and `--output-file`; `--fix` edits notebook cells; releases carry SLSA Build Level 3 provenance
  (GitHub artifact attestations); `--fix` types calls to functions in other checked files.
  `check_source`, `check_tree` and `annotation_coverage` take their options as one `Checks`.
