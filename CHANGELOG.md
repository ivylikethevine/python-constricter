## Unreleased

- First release, 0.2.0: `LVA001`–`LVA006`, the `relaxed` to `suffocate` levels, a flake8 plugin, a
  pylint plugin and the `constricter` command (with `--fix`, `--diff`, `--explain`, `--select`,
  `--ignore`, `--statistics` and text, JSON, GitHub and SARIF output), configured from
  `[tool.constricter]` in `pyproject.toml`. Python 3.11+. Also baselines (`--write-baseline`,
  `--baseline`), Jupyter notebooks, a GitHub Action, `--jobs`, per-path levels, and JSON with
  comments wherever constricter reads JSON. `--coverage` reports annotation coverage; standard
  input, `gitlab`, `junit` and `rdjson` output, `--unsafe-fixes`, per-file ignores, `--exit-zero`
  and `--output-file`; `--fix` edits notebook cells; releases carry SLSA Build Level 3 provenance
  (GitHub artifact attestations); `--fix` types calls to functions in other checked files.
